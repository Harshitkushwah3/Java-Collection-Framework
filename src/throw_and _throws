We use the throws keyword in the method declaration to declare the type of exception that might occur with in it.

ex:-
pc{.......
    public static void file() throws IOException{
    ........
    }

The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw a single exception.

ex:-
pc{.......
    public class void file(){
    throw new AirthmeticException(" Divide by zero")
    .......
    }
