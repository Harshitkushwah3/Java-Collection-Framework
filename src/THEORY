The Java Collection Framework is a key component of the Java Standard Library.
It provides classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Below are the major topics covered in the Java Collection Framework:

->1. Core Interfaces
    Collection Interface: Root interface for most collections.
    List: Ordered collection with duplicate elements.
        Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack
    Set: Unordered collection that doesnâ€™t allow duplicate elements.
        Examples: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
    Queue: Used for elements to be processed in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) or other order.
        Examples: PriorityQueue, Deque (subinterface)
    Deque: Double-ended queue, supporting element addition/removal at both ends.
        Examples: ArrayDeque
    Map Interface: Represents key-value pairs (not a subtype of Collection).
        Examples: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
    SortedSet and SortedMap: Provides elements in sorted order.

->2. Implementations (Classes)
    ArrayList: Dynamic array, resizable, good for random access.
    LinkedList: Doubly linked list, good for frequent insertions/deletions.
    HashSet: Unordered collection, uses hashing for fast lookups.
    TreeSet: Sorted collection implemented using a Red-Black Tree.
    HashMap: Stores key-value pairs, allows one null key and multiple null values.
    TreeMap: Sorted key-value pairs, implemented using a Red-Black Tree.
    ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe version of HashMap.

->3. Utilities
    Collections Class: Provides utility methods (e.g., sorting, searching, reversing).
    Arrays Class: Provides static methods for array manipulation (e.g., sorting, searching).

->4. Advanced Concepts
    Iterators:
        Iterator: Generic iterator for traversing elements.
        ListIterator: Bi-directional traversal for lists.
    Enumeration: Legacy interface for traversing elements (used with Vector or Hashtable).
    Stream API: Introduced in Java 8 for functional programming with collections.
    Comparator and Comparable: Interfaces for sorting.
    Concurrency in Collections:
        Synchronized collections: Collections.synchronizedList, synchronizedSet
        Concurrent collections: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList

->5. Special Types of Collections
    Stack: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
    Vector: Legacy synchronized list implementation.
    PriorityQueue: Ordered based on natural ordering or comparator.
    WeakHashMap: Keys are garbage-collected when no references exist.

->6. Generics
    Allows type-safe collections, ensuring type consistency at compile time.
        Example: List<String> instead of raw List.

->7. Performance Considerations
    Comparison of time complexities for different operations (e.g., ArrayList vs. LinkedList).
    Trade-offs between different collections (e.g., HashMap vs. TreeMap
